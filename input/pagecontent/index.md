### Introduction
This document specifies the exchange format for cancer registration.   
On January 1st 2020 the new National Law on Cancer Registration (NLCR) and the according Ordinance on Cancer Registration (OCR) enters into force.

For further information on the legal framework, please consult the website of the National Agency for Cancer Registration ([NACR](https://www.nkrs.ch/)) or the website of the Federal Office of Public Health ([FOPH](https://www.bag.admin.ch/), keyword “Krebsregistrierung”, “Enregistrement du cancer”, “Registrazione delle malattie tumorali”).
